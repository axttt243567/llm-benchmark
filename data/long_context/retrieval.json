In 1642, Blaise Pascal invented the Pascaline, a mechanical calculator. Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine in 1837, which is considered the first general-purpose computer concept. Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm intended for machine processing in 1843. The ENIAC, completed in 1945, was the first electronic general-purpose computer. It weighed 30 tons and occupied 1,800 square feet. The transistor was invented at Bell Labs in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley. The first commercial computer, UNIVAC I, was delivered to the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951. IBM introduced the IBM 701 in 1952. The integrated circuit was invented independently by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1958-1959. Intel released the first commercial microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971. The Apple II was released in 1977, and the IBM PC in 1981. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN.\n[END PASSAGE]\n\nQuestion: What year was the transistor invented and who were the three inventors?"
