      "prompt": "Read the following story and determine the final location of the 'Obsidian Amulet'.\n\nChapter 1: The Beginning\nElias stood in the center of the Great Hall. In his right hand, he held the Obsidian Amulet. It was cold to the touch. He placed the Amulet carefully into his leather satchel, which he slung over his left shoulder. He then walked out of the hall and into the courtyard.\n\nChapter 2: The Encounter\nIn the courtyard, Elias met Sarah. Sarah asked for a map. Elias opened his satchel to find the map. While the satchel was open, he took out the Obsidian Amulet and handed it to Sarah so he could dig deeper for the map. Sarah held the Amulet in her pocket while Elias looked. Elias found the map, gave it to Sarah, and closed his satchel. Sarah forgot to give the Amulet back and walked away towards the stables.\n\nChapter 3: The Stables\nSarah arrived at the stables and greeted the groom, Thomas. She reached into her pocket to pay him a coin but accidentally pulled out the Obsidian Amulet instead. 'That's a nice stone,' Thomas said. Sarah realized her mistake. She put the Amulet back into her own pocket and handed Thomas a gold coin. Thomas took the coin. Sarah then mounted her horse and rode to the village.\n\nChapter 4: The Village Market\nAt the market, Sarah met a merchant named Olin. She wanted to buy a sword. She didn't have enough gold, so she offered the Obsidian Amulet as trade. Olin accepted. Olin took the Amulet and placed it inside a locked wooden chest behind his counter. He gave the key to the chest to his assistant, Brem.\n\nChapter 5: The Theft\nLater that night, a thief named Kael broke into the market. He saw the locked wooden chest. He picked the lock successfully. He opened the chest and saw the Obsidian Amulet. He grabbed the Amulet and replaced it with a heavy rock. Kael ran to the docks and hid the Amulet inside a hollow barrel labeled 'Herring'.\n\nQuestion: Based on the story, exactly where is the Obsidian Amulet currently located?",

Standard business attire (suits, ties, formal dresses) is required Monday through Friday. No denim is permitted on premises.\n\nSECTION 2: CAFETERIA RULES\nLunch hours are 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. No food at desks.\n\nSECTION 3: UPDATE TO DRESS CODE (Dated March 2021)\nDue to employee feedback, the company is instituting 'Casual Fridays'. On Fridays only, employees are permitted to wear polo shirts and khakis. Denim is still strictly prohibited. Monday through Thursday remains Standard Business Attire.\n\nSECTION 4: PARKING\nEmployees must park in the blue zone.\n\nSECTION 5: SUMMER POLICY UPDATE (Dated June 2022)\nDuring the summer months (June-August), shorts are permitted. This supersedes previous sections regarding legwear for these months.\n\nSECTION 6: WORK FROM HOME POLICY (Dated Jan 2023)\nEmployees working remotely may wear whatever they choose.\n\nSECTION 7: FINAL DRESS CODE REVISION (Dated Sept 2023)\nEffective immediately, the 'Casual Friday' policy is expanded. On Fridays, employees may now wear Blue Jeans (Denim) and T-Shirts, provided the T-Shirts have no offensive logos. This specific change overrides the 'No Denim' clause found in Section 1 and Section 3.\n\n--- DOCUMENT END ---\n\nQuestion: It is October 2023. An employee is coming into the office on a Friday. According to the latest active rules, are they allowed to wear Blue Jeans? Explain why or why not citing the sections.",

The company has taken steps to ensure a safe workplace by prohibiting any fashion-related offense on Fridays.\n3. The policy can be expanded to cover the summer months (June-August), when shorts are permitted, and applies to employees working remotely.\n4. The employee is allowed to wear blue jeans at work if they choose them, as long as their T-Shirts do not contain offensive logos or have no offensive symbols. This specific change does not conflict with previous policies.\n5. Despite the updated policy, it's essential to note that the company remains flexible and can modify the dress code to accommodate any potential offense.",
