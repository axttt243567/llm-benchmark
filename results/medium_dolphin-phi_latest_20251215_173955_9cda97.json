      "timestamp": "2025-12-15T17:40:39.551443",
      "response": "Binary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The comparison counts in binary search always involve at least 2 elements: the value to be found and one element from the input array (the middle element of the search interval).\n\nTo find the maximum number of comparisons needed in a binary search, let's consider this scenario:\n\n1. Start with an empty search interval.\n2. When we are searching for an element in the sorted list, at each comparison, we eliminate half of the remaining elements in the array. In other words, if the target value is less than the middle element, then it will be present in the left half of the remaining elements; otherwise, it will be in the right half.\n3. Since we divide the search interval in half with each comparison, the number of comparisons can be expressed as `log2(n)` where 'n' is the total number of elements.\n\nIn this case, there are 1000 elements in the sorted list. So, the maximum number of comparisons needed to find an element using binary search would be:\n\n```max_comparisons = log2(1000) = 9.966... ≈ 10`\n\nSo, the maximum number of comparisons required in a binary search for a sorted list of 1000 elements is approximately 10.",

The stored honey serves as a crucial source of food during times when there is limited floral resources or when winter approaches, allowing the colony to survive through harsh conditions.

The First and Second Estates were exempt from paying taxes, leading to a significant wealth disparity between them and the rest of the population.\n\n2. Economic Crisis: France was facing severe economic troubles due to massive spending on wars, extravagant royal living, and high taxes, which led to widespread poverty, unemployment, and hunger. This economic crisis fueled resentment among the Third Estate.\n\n3. Absolute Monarchy: King Louis XVI's absolute power and his inability to address the nation's problems were major factors in the revolution. The King was seen as weak and out of touch with the people, leading to increasing calls for reform and a more democratic government.\n\n4. Enlightenment Ideas: The ideas of the Enlightenment, such as liberty, equality, and fraternity, spread among the French population and played a significant role in inspiring them to rise against their rulers.\n\n5. Financial Crisis: The financial crisis was exacerbated by King Louis XVI's decision to sell the royal estates at low prices and his inability to pay the debts of the state, which further intensified the economic strain on the nation.\n\nIn summary, the French Revolution was caused by a combination of social inequality, economic crisis, absolute monarchy, enlightenment ideas, and financial problems in France during the late 18th century. These factors led to widespread discontent among the people and eventually resulted in the revolution.",

The `is_prime` function checks if a number is a prime number, by checking divisibility starting from 2 and 3. If it finds a number that is not prime, it breaks out of the loop. If it goes through all numbers without finding any non-prime, then it prints out the current number along with its count (which starts as 1) and increases the count.",
