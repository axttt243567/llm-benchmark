However, if the statement is referring to the present or future, without any indication of when it last rained or how wet the streets are now, then its truth cannot be definitively confirmed.\n\nIn terms of logic:\n1. If it is NOT raining and the streets are dry, it means that it didn't rain in the past, and therefore, it might have rained in the past. However, we don't have enough information to know for certain whether it will rain in the future. So the statement \"It might be raining\" could be true or false based on the time context.\n2. If the statement refers to a time in the present or future and there is no information about when it last rained or how wet the streets are now, then we cannot determine the truth value of the statement without more context.\n\nIn summary, the statement \"It might be raining\" can be considered true if referring to the past, but its truth value in the present or future depends on additional context.",
