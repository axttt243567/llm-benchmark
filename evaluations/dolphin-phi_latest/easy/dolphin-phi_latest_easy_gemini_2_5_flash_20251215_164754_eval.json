If it is NOT raining and the streets are dry, it means that it didn't rain in the past, and therefore, it might have rained in the past. However, we don't have enough information to know for certain whether it will rain in the future. So the statement \"It might be raining\" could be true or false based on the time context.\n2.

      "response": "To reverse the word 'cat', you just need to switch its characters in order. So the reversed word will be 'tac'. Here is how this can be coded in Python:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_word(word):\n    return word[::-1]\n\nprint(reverse_word('cat'))  # prints: tac\n```\n\nIn this code, the function `reverse_word` takes a string as an argument and uses Python's slice syntax to create a reversed copy of the string. The `[::-1]` syntax means \"start from end of string up until the beginning, then step backwards by one\". \n\nThe result is a new string with the characters in reverse order. If you call this function with 'cat', it will return 'tac'.",
